## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter your name and (optionally) license key.
- Default: Demo
- Use `FULL-ACCESS` to unlock full mode.
3. Choose voice (if TTS available) and enable.
4. Upload files:
- PDF → text extracted (or OCR fallback).
- TXT → direct import.
- Image → OCR.
- ZIP → unpack if JSZip included.
5. Click **Process**.
6. Use tabs to navigate:
- Library: view documents.
- Summaries: generate quick/detailed summaries.
- Quiz: create practice MCQs.
- Manage: targets, backup/restore.
- Settings: OCR language, theme.

## Limitations

- OCR (Tesseract) is CPU-intensive on mobile; large PDFs may be slow.
- Voice output depends on your browser/system voices.
- Current quiz/summary logic is demo-level; better NLP/LLM can be integrated later.

## Roadmap / Planned

- Improved quiz generation using LLM API.
- KBC-style game mode with audio cues.
- Multi-user progress tracking.
- Cloud backup option.
- Integration of more Indian languages (OCR + TTS).
